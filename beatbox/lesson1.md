# Basic beatbox patterns for beginners | Tutorial

Hey Guys, so this just gonna be a quick tutorial on how to do three basic beatbox patterns. The sounds that you need to know in order do these beats are the basic BTK.
大家好，这是一个关于三种基本beatbox节奏型的教程。完成这些节拍你需要模仿三种基本的声音B,T,K。

The B's are gonna be kick drums, T's are high hats and k's are snares.

B是脚鼓，T是踩镲，k是军鼓。

The way this is gonna work is that I'm gonna do the beats twice in full speed so the speed that you'd normally do that and then twice at a slower speed. So the first beat goes like this:
每一个节奏我将以正常速度重复两边，再用慢速重复两遍。第一个节奏是这样的：

BTT-KTT-TBT-KTT

and slow down, you should sounds something like (repeat twice).

慢一点就应该是这样的：

Ok that was the first beat if you guys need help with that feel free to rewind or leave a comment below.

好，这就是第一个节拍，如果你需要帮助，可以倒回去看或者在评论区留言。

All right the second beat goes something like this:

第二个节拍是这样的：

BTTT-KTTT-TTBT-KTTT

and slow down you should sound like this: (repeat twice)

And finally the third beats sounds like this:

KTT-BKTT-BTT-BTK-TTT

and slow down you should sound like this: (repeat twice)

Alright those are all the beats for today, if you guys have any questions about how to do any of the beats feel free to rewind or comment down below and I will try to answer it as quick and as best as possible. If you guys like the video please like and yeah I will see you guys next time.

So just a couple disclaimers before we start the video. Number one as you can probably tell I'm a pretty garbage beatboxer so I'm sorry if my beatboxing just so terrible but beatboxing is just something I do for fun. And number two yes I did make these beats myself but they may sound really familiar because I took inspiration from a lot of other beatboxers.
