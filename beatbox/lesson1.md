# Basic beatbox patterns for beginners | Tutorial

Hey Guys, so this just gonna be a quick tutorial on how to do three basic beatbox patterns. The sounds that you need to know in order do these beats are the basic BTK.

The bees are gonna be kick drums, T's are high hats and k's are snares.

So just a couple disclaimers before we start the video. Number one as you can probably tell I'm a pretty garbage beatboxer so I'm sorry if my beatboxing just so terrible but beatboxing is just something I do for fun. And number two yes I did make these beats myself but they may sound really familiar because I took inspiration from a lot of other beatboxers.

The way this is gonna work is that I'm gonna do the beats twice in full speed so the speed that you'd normally do that and then twice at a slower speed. So the first beat goes like this:

BTT-KTT-TBT-KTT

and slow down, you should sounds something like (repeat twice).

Ok that was the first beat if you guys need help with that feel free to rewind or leave a comment below.

All right the second beat goes something like this:

BTTT-KTTT-TTBT-KTTT

and slow down you should sound like this: (repeat twice)

And finally the third beats sounds like this:

KTT-BKTT-BTT-BTK-TTT

and slow down you should sound like this: (repeat twice)

Alright those are all the beats for today, if you guys have any questions about how to do any of the beats feel free to rewind or comment down below and I will try to answer it as quick and as best as possible. If you guys like the video please like and yeah I will see you guys next time.
