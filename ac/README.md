# AC not working
When summer comes along, you need your air conditioner to run without a hitch, and even the best air conditioners can run into issues with time. So, what do you do if your central AC unit is not working properly? Don't worry, use this air conditioning troublesshooting list to hlep you identify some common air conditioner problems and identify solutions.

## AC not cooling
### AC won't blow cold air
If your AC system runs on but doesn't blow out cold air, ensure all the vents are open and the thermostat is set properly. If these aren't the problem, check the air filter. If it is clogged with dirt or other debris, you won't get any air flow. Since the clog may cause the evaporator coils to freeze, the ice and frost will clog the air flow even more. If that's the problem, clean the filter with a soft brush, mild soap, and water. Clean and change your filter often to avoid that problem in the future. You may also have a problem getting electrical power to the motor or a leak in the refrigerant line. In these cases, you will require a qualified HVAC technician to come inspect the unit.

### Air conditioner not cooling enough
Check your vents to make sure all of them are open. If even one of them is closed, it can make it more difficult to cool your entire home, since the warm air from the room with the closed vent will mix with the cooled air from the others.
Otherwise, you may have anohter problem, such as a leak in your refrigerant line. If you system is old or was installed improperly, it may be wearing our or is the wrong size for your home. Systems that are too large for your home will cycle on and off too quickly, reducing their efficiency. A system that's too small for your home will work harder to cool your home, leading to premature breakdown.

## Air conditioner leaking water
### Air conditioner leaking water inside
To avoid costly water damage, turn your AC off if it leaks water inside your home. Your condensate drain line might be clogged up, causing water to back up into your home. DIYers can try using a wet/dry vacuum to unclog the line. If that doesn't work, your drain pan may have rusted out or yhour condensate pump may have broken down. Your technician will be able to replace or repair the damaged parts.

### AC leaking water outside
On hot or humid days, you might see a little puddle of water under your condenser unit. In hot, humid weather, that's normal, as long as it only forms while the unit is working. In cool weather - usually, 60 degrees or less - an air conditioner can freeze up, causing the unit to leak water when it melts which is also normal. If it is leaking in other circustance, try cleaning or repalcing your air filters. If that doesn't ix the problem, schedule a service call. You may need more refrigerant, have a blockge in your drain pipe, or have a broken condensate pan.

### AC leaking water when turned off
If your system is low on refrigerant o has a dirty filter, the system mayh freeze up when it's working. After you turn it off, the ice melts, causing it to leak water.
